# JsonWax
JsonWax is a Qt C++ class for handling JSON-documents. It's an alternative to Qt's built-in class.

With this, you can handle JSON-documents in a manner that directly relates to the structure of the document, while not needing to think of the concepts of JSON-Arrays, JSON-Objects and JSON-Values. Essentially, finding a value in a JSON-document is like
finding a file, where the path to the file is a sequence of strings and/or numbers.
With this class you can write the whole "directory" in one line, which makes nested JSON-documents easy to use and manipulate.

The files may be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.0 or the GNU General Public license version 3 or any later version.

*** Could still use some more tests, however it is currently in working condition ***
